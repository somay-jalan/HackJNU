## Problem Statment:
Addressing the current Sustainable Development Goals of the UN, the issue of 'Life Below Water' has become a global concern. Expanding upon the research paper [link provided](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10654714/)), we have implemented real-time analysis to scale up our efforts. Recorded feed from the water bodies is being used to record observations of behavioral changes in aquatic life to analyze the rapid impact of human interference and environmental pollution. These observations serve as crucial indicators for local authorities, enabling them to take prompt action.

## Requirements
see requirements.txt

## RawDataSet
The raw dataset generated and/or analyzed during the present study are now [available](http://140.121.135.204/aicenter/publications.html), under the repository name of Anomaly Behavior Recognition of underwater creatures Using Lite 3D Full-Convolution Network.

## Train
You can train your model with train.py\
`python train.py  --output mix_fars_v04_result/`

## Test
You can test your model for any real time input. A default recorded feed for a specified fish is added. Run the commands:
'python3 test.py'

## Tech Stack
